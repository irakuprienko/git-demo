I got voices in my head again, tread carefully
And I don't medicate, it helps me temporarily
I got problems, I got issues, yeah, apparently
Trauma that I'm burying, I think I need some therapy
I battle depression, I'm back with a message
I'm asking the question that if you hate me, why you actin' obsessive?
